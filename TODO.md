* DONE - Test the model's prediction capabilities with custom paint images 
* DONE - An "accuracies ladder" to track the best models performances
* DONE - Represent in real time the training of the network's weights. Save the training process in an animation gif
* DONE - Implement the different activation functions (sigmoid, relu, tanh)
* DONE - Implement output regularization functions (softmax, simple norm)
* DONE - Implement dropout
* NOT DONE - Saving of the best network state during the training phase
* NOT DONE - Implement the simple norm regularization derivative for backpropagation
* NOT DONE - Solve the learning bugs with the softmax regularization
* NOT DONE - Auto-adjusting learning rate for optimization
* NOT DONE - Code the graphic model testing interface with GTK
* NOT DONE - Automate the model creation/training processes, to have macro view of the best models to train and which hyper-parameters are the best
* NOT DONE - Find a way to have the gpu doing matrix calculations --> would be much faster
