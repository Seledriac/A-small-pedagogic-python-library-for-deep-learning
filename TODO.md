* DONE - Test the model's prediction capabilities with custom paint images 
* DONE - Represent in real time the training of the network's weights. Save the training process in an animation gif
* DONE - Implement the different activation functions (sigmoid, relu, tanh)
* NOT DONE - Implement the simple norm regularization derivative for backpropagation
* NOT DONE - Solve the learning bugs with the softmax regularization
* NOT DONE - Code the graphic model testing interface with tkinter            
* NOT DONE - Find a way to have the gpu doing matrix calculations --> would be much faster
