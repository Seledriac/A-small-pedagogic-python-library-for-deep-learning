* DONE - Test the model's prediction capabilities with custom paint images 
* DONE - An "accuracies ladder" to track the best models performances
* DONE - Represent in real time the training of the network's weights. Save the training process in an animation gif
* DONE - Implement the different activation functions (sigmoid, relu, tanh)
* DONE - Implement output regulation functions (softmax, simple norm) and their derivatives for backpropagation
* DONE - Implement dropout
* DONE - Saving of the best network state during the training phase
* DONE - Auto-adjusting learning rate for learning speed optimization
* DONE - Implement flags per epoch parameter tweaking, and verbose accuracy tracking during training
* DONE - Code the graphic model testing interface with tkinter
* NOT DONE - Find a way to modify the QPainter brush to get better live predictions with the gui tool
* NOT DONE - Automate the model creation/training processes, to have macro view of the best models to train and which hyper-parameters are the best
* NOT DONE - Find a way to have the gpu doing matrix calculations --> would be much faster
